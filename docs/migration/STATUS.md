# Migration status

| Phase | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Infrastructure, oracle, baselines | **done, except two items deferred** | Deferred: USB pcapng recording (needs root once, see `tools/usb/README.md`) and performance baselines (moved to Phase 1b/2, see DEVIATIONS.md) |
| 1 Formats + store | **1a done** (reading, saving, CSV/VCD export through Rust behind `DSVIEW_IMPL_FORMATS`); 1b store next | See "Phase 1a" below |
| 2 Decoder engine | not started | |
| 3 Drivers | not started | |
| 4 Session + control API | not started | |

## Phase 0 deliverables

**Workspace:** `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.98), `deny.toml`, `.config/nextest.toml`, and the
`cargo xtask` alias. `dsview-mcp` is now a member.

**Rust core in the C++ build:**
- `crates/dsview-ffi` exports `dsv_version()`.
- `-DDSVIEW_RUST_CORE=ON` links it into DSView, which then logs "Rust core: 0.1.0" at startup.

**C oracle** (`dev/dsview-oracle`) compiles the original libsigrok4DSL, libsigrokdecode4DSL and common
sources:
- `oracle-decode` runs the C decoder engine exactly as `DecoderStack` does and prints JSONL. On
  protocol.demo it produces 8,379 annotations, the same count DSView reports for the same file over
  the control API.
- `oracle-dsl` loads a capture through the C session driver and prints per-channel hashes. These match
  the raw `L-n/0` blocks in the file.

**Test kit, corpus and goldens:**
- `testdata/corpus.json` pins the 9 demo captures by SHA-256.
- `testdata/golden/{dsl,decode}` holds the C outputs.
- Commands: `cargo xtask golden gen|check`, `cargo xtask corpus init|verify`.

**Control-API baseline:**
- `testdata/control/demo-scenario.json` has 38 steps covering all 31 methods.
- It was recorded from the Qt DSView with `cargo xtask control record`, and is checked with
  `cargo xtask control check`.

**USB baseline tooling:**
- `cargo xtask usb record` covers 11 DSLogic scenarios.
- All of them pass on the DSLogic Plus in `--dry-run` mode.

**CI:** `.github/workflows/rust.yml` runs lint, tests, cargo-deny, golden check and a portability check.

**Removed:** the stale `DSView/test` and `libsigrok4DSL/tests`.

## Phase 1a (formats): status

**Done and verified:**
- **`crates/dsview-formats`:**
  - GKeyFile-compatible INI parser.
  - The header interpreted exactly like the C loader, including all quirks and the security hardening.
  - Samplerate parsing (F3).
  - `.dsl`/`.demo` reader for logic, DSO and analog, versions 1-3, with size limits.
  - Pull-based packet stream with the C driver's packet boundaries.
  - A writer for logic captures.
- **Differential tests:**
  - The Rust reader equals the C session driver on all 9 corpus files: headers, channels, data hashes and
    packet counts (`tests/golden_dsl.rs`).
  - Rust-written files read back identically in C (`cargo xtask golden check`).
  - Three synthetic multi-block captures (up to 3 blocks, odd sample counts, packet boundaries in the middle
    of a block) read identically by C and Rust.
- **Fuzzing:** targets `header` and `dsl_reader`. 2.3 million and 145,000 runs found no crash.
- **FFI seam:**
  - `dsv_dsl_*` in `crates/dsview-ffi` with a cbindgen header.
  - `libsigrok4DSL/session_driver.c` loads captures through Rust when `DSVIEW_IMPL_FORMATS=rust` (or
    `DSVIEW_IMPL=rust`) is set and DSView is built with `-DDSVIEW_RUST_CORE=ON`.
  - `cargo xtask control ab --bin <DSView>` runs the same probes through a live DSView with both readers;
    all 9 captures give identical results.
  - The crafted malicious files are rejected by the Rust reader with a clear log message.

**Saving and export (second step of 1a):**
- **Saving:** `DslZipWriter` behind `ZipMaker` (`dsv_zip_writer_*`) and `dsv_dsl_entry` behind `ZipReader`.
  `StoreSession` uses `ZipMaker::Discard`, so a cancelled Rust save keeps the previous file.
- **Export:** CSV and VCD exporters behind libsigrok's output-module interface
  (`libsigrok4DSL/output/rs_output.c`, chosen in `sr_output_list()`).
- **One switch:** `dsv_use_rust("FORMATS")` decides for the session driver, export and save.
- **Byte-exact checks** (`dev/dsview-oracle/tests/export_diff.rs`):
  - Rust CSV (logic/DSO/analog) and VCD against the C modules on 400 random cases each.
  - `%.15g`, `%.5f` and `%.0f` against glibc `snprintf`.
  - Findings F5 (locale) and F6 (crash) reproduced.
- **Live A/B** (`cargo xtask control ab`): opening, CSV/VCD export and saving every corpus capture inside a
  running DSView gives identical results with `DSVIEW_IMPL=c` and `rust`. Rust-saved files read
  identically in the C loader; the only header difference is the wall-clock `trigger time`.
  - Also runs in CI from a `DESTDIR`-staged install.

**Left for later (see DEVIATIONS.md, "Departures"):**
- `.dsc` profiles (Phase 4/5).
- srzip export.
- Making Rust the default after one release of A/B.
